### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved exploring the HR data to answer key questions such as:

- Total number of staff members.
- Total number of current staff members.
- Average satisfaction level of employees in each department.
- Number of employees per business travel.
- Performance level of each staff.
- Number of employees who left the company in each department (Attrition & Attrition Rate).
- Gender count of employee.
- Age band of employee.



### Data Analysis Process
---
#### Step 1: Data Collection.
The dataset was extracted from IBM analytics platform.

#### Step 2: Data Cleaning/Preparation.
 In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks using Excel and Power Query:
  1. Data loading and inspection.
  2. Handling missing values.
  3. Data cleaning and formatting.

#### Step 3: Data Aggregation.
- Used Excel Pivot Tables to summarise data for various factors.
- Summarized data using Excel Pivot Tables for Employee Overview.
- Calculated attrition rate by comparing the numbers for different factors.

#### Step 4: Data Analysis.
- Analysed average satisfaction levels and categorised them into Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Very Dissatisfied and Dissatisfied,
- Evaluated the correlation between employee satisfaction levels, performance levels, business travels and total working years.
- Examined employee count and attrritio count across departments.
-  Assessed attrition per job role, educational levels, age bands and gender.

#### Step 5: Visualisation & Insights
- Created pivot tables and charts to visualise trends.
- Derived insights to support HR decision-making, such as potential areas for employee engagement improvements, gender and age bands trends.

  

### Results
---
#### Promotion Overview

#### General Insights

- **Promotion Count**: 521 employees were promoted, representing **17.37%** of the total workforce.
- **Training Participation**:  
  - **Yes**: 1,828 employees (61%)  
  - **No**: 1,172 employees (39%)

- **Training ROI Concerns**:  
  - Only **28.5% of the training budget** (261K) went to employees promoted within 6 months.  
  - **71.5% of the budget** (654K) was spent on employees who were not promoted ‚Äî indicating a potential **gap in post-training evaluation or application**.

### Recommendations
---
1. **Reassess Training Content** for Marketing and Sales to align better with performance objectives.
2. **Expand Training Coverage** in IT and Sales to reduce the untrained employee ratio.
3. **Replicate Finance Department Strategies** across others, as it achieved the best score improvement per cost spent.
4. Consider **performance-based training budget allocation** ‚Äî shifting focus to high-impact departments.


### Limitations
 ---
1. ##### **Limited Scope of Variables**
   The analysis focuses on core metrics such as training cost, promotion rate, and score improvements. Other important HR factors like employee satisfaction, engagement, retention rate, or qualitative feedback were not considered.

2. ##### **Training Effectiveness Not Fully Captured**
   The improvement score is quantitative and may not reflect behavioral changes or practical, on-the-job performance. The long-term impact of training is not assessed.

3. ##### **Lack of Clarity on Promotion Criteria**
   The report assumes a connection between training and promotion but does not clarify the actual criteria for promotions. Factors like tenure, manager recommendation, or performance evaluations may also influence promotions.

4. ##### **Data Granularity Constraints**
   The data is aggregated at the department level, which may mask insights from individual or team-level performance. High performers or underperformers may be hidden within averages.

5. ##### **Unclear Timeframe**
   The timeframe of data collection (monthly, quarterly, or yearly) is not specified, making it difficult to identify trends or seasonality in training outcomes and promotions.

 ### Conclusion
---
The Power BI dashboard highlights critical patterns in training efficiency, departmental performance, and promotion outcomes. DYKE INTERGRATED can leverage these insights to **optimize HR strategies**, ensure **cost-effective training**, and **foster talent development** organization-wide.
